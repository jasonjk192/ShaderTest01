# ShaderTest01
A bunch of shaders made in Unity

- Glass Shader

    Simple shader that blends image behind a transparent object like glass
    
- Raymarch

    Simple shader that uses raymarching to create a virtual spherical object within a cube with lighting applied on it
    
- Outline

    2 methods for creating outlines around a mesh
    
- Toon

    A simple cartoon shader that uses a ramp texture to create different levels of lighting. Also utilizes the outlining from the outline shader to complete the effect
    
- Volumetric Clouds

    A shader that generates clouds within a cube. Highly customisable.
    
- Clouds On Camera

    An extension to the previous shader where the clouds are generated in the camera view rather than inside a cube object.
